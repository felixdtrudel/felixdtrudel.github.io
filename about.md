<h1>About</h1>

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher from the [Québec Research Funds - Society and Culture](http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/accueil) and [BrainsCAN program (CFREF)](https://brainscan.uwo.ca/index.html) in the [Language, Reading, and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.psychology.uwo.ca/lrcn/index.html) (Department of Psychology and Brain and Mind Institute), directed by [Dr. Marc Joanisse](http://publish.uwo.ca/~marcj/), at Western University in London, ON. I completed my Ph.D. with [Dr. Tania Zamuner](http://artsites.uottawa.ca/zamuner/?lang=en) in Ottawa, ON.

My research focuses on **speech, phonological, and lexical processing in monolinguals and bilinguals**. I have worked with adults and children using a variety of methods such as EEG and standard perception tests, but my main expertise is in **eye tracking**. I use **mixed-effects regression methods** to **model** speech production, processing, and word learning.

My past research has also investigated **speech production**, focusing on **vowel nasalization in French and Portuguese** using acoustic and airflow measurements.

I am originally from [Québec City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City), one of Canada's oldest French-speaking cities and the province capital, which is the last remaining inhabited fortified city in North America. I completed my B.A. and M.A. degrees at _Université Laval_ [Languages, Linguistics, and Translation](http://www.lli.ulaval.ca) with [Dr. Johanna-Pascale Roy](https://www.phonetique.ulaval.ca).

In the last few years, I have been lucky enough to travel for training in São Paulo (Brazil), Nijmegen (Netherlands), Edmonton (Canada), and Utrecht (Netherlands), in addition to conference trips in Moncton (Canada), Glasgow (Scotland), Ithaca (USA), Toronto (Canada), New York City (USA), and Lisbon (Portugal).
