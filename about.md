<h1>About</h1>

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychology/) at the University of Toronto Mississauga. I work with Dr. Elizabeth Johnson ([Child Language and Speech Studies Lab](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/infant-child-centre/child-language-and-speech-studies-lab)) and Dr. Craig Chambers ([Perception, Action, and Language Lab](https://www.psycholinguistics.ca/pal)) on word learning and speech processing across development. I have completed postdoctoral work in the [Language, Reading, and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://www.psychology.uwo.ca/lrcn/index.html) (Department of Psychology and Brain and Mind Institute), directed by [Dr. Marc Joanisse](http://publish.uwo.ca/~marcj/), at Western University in London, ON. I completed my Ph.D. with [Dr. Tania Zamuner](https://taniazamuner.weebly.com) in Ottawa, ON.

My research focuses on **language processing in monolingual and bilingual adults and children**, with a focus on speech sounds and words. I have used a variety of methods such as EEG and standard perception tests, but my main expertise is in **eye tracking**. I use **mixed-effects regression methods** to **model** speech and word production, language processing, and learning.

I have also investigated **speech production**, focusing on **vowel nasalization in French and Portuguese** using acoustic and airflow measurements.

I am originally from [Québec City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City), one of Canada's oldest French-speaking cities and the province capital, which is the last remaining inhabited fortified city in North America. I completed my B.A. and M.A. degrees at _Université Laval_ [Languages, Linguistics, and Translation](http://www.lli.ulaval.ca) with [Dr. Johanna-Pascale Roy](https://www.phonetique.ulaval.ca).
