I am currently completing my Ph.D. program under the supervision of [Dr. Tania Zamuner](http://artsites.uottawa.ca/zamuner/?lang=en) in Ottawa, ON, Canada.

I am originally from [Québec City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City), one of Canada's oldest French-speaking cities and the province capital, which is the last remaining inhabited fortified city in North America. I completed my B.A. and M.A. degrees at _Université Laval_ [Languages, Linguistics, and Translation](http://www.lli.ulaval.ca) under the supervision of [Dr. Johanna-Pascale Roy](https://www.phonetique.ulaval.ca).
