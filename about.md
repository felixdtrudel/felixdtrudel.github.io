<h1>About</h1>

I am currently completing my Ph.D. program under the supervision of [Dr. Tania Zamuner](http://artsites.uottawa.ca/zamuner/?lang=en) in Ottawa, ON, Canada.

My research focuses on **speech, phonological, and lexical processing in monolinguals and bilinguals**. I have worked with adults and children using a variety of methods such as EEG and standard perception tests, but my main expertise is in **eye tracking**. My past research has also investigated **speech production**, focusing on **vowel nasalization in French and Portuguese** using acoustics and airflow measurements.

I am originally from [Québec City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City), one of Canada's oldest French-speaking cities and the province capital, which is the last remaining inhabited fortified city in North America. I completed my B.A. and M.A. degrees at _Université Laval_ [Languages, Linguistics, and Translation](http://www.lli.ulaval.ca) under the supervision of [Dr. Johanna-Pascale Roy](https://www.phonetique.ulaval.ca).

In the last few years, I have been lucky enough to travel for training in São Paulo (Brazil), Nijmegen (Netherlands), Edmonton (Canada), and Utrecht (Netherlands), in addition to conference trips in Moncton (Canada), Glasgow (Scotland), Ithaca (USA), Toronto (Canada), and New York City (USA). I will be going to Lisbon (Portugal) at the beginning of the 2018 summer.
